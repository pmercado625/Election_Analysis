# Election Audit Summary
This script can be used within any general election to provide the voter count as well as the percentage. The candidates can be modified to handle any number of candidates and the counties can be used to identify any particular demographic/geographical/misc aspect by which to group each of the voter. For example, if someone wanted to know what kind of ethnicities/races participated within a certain election, one can simply adjust the counties to identifiable races/nationalities and gather information for that specific purpose. In another way, the scipt could be modified to tally/poll for voter satisfaction for a certain candidate. One could simply adjust the included dictionaries to keep track of a certain satisfaction level (ex: 1-5) and count each vote for each satisfaction level. Thus one could find how satisfied a group of people are of either the candidate that they choose or the current person in a role.
